# Brain Tumor Detection and localization | Prof. Soumya Dutta(CS661A) Feb’23‑April’23
• Examined MRI brain scans to create a 3D representation of brain tumors.
• Developed a user‑friendly interface with sliders for adjusting brain and tumor opacity, and defining tumor boundaries.
• Distinguished tumor types by utilizing 2D coordinates, determining the percentage of tumor cells within the brain, and estimating
brain mass.
• Successfully executed the project on the BRATS_HG0015_T1C.mha dataset, which encompasses 176 MRI scans.
• Identified the tumor as glioma, pinpointing 0.39% of brain cells as tumor cells and estimating a mass of approximately 0.71g.
